FILTERING ACCESS

This example shows how a request containing user data passes
 a sequential chain of handlers that perform various things 
 such as authentication, authorization, and validation.

This example is a bit different from the canonical version 
of the pattern given by various authors. Most of the pattern
 examples are built on the notion of looking for the right
handler, launching it and exiting the chain after that. 
But here we execute every handler until there’s one that 
can’t handle a request. Be aware that this still is the 
Chain of Responsibility pattern, even though the flow 
is a bit different.
